# n8n Self-Hosted Stack on AWS

A comprehensive AWS CloudFormation template that automatically deploys a complete n8n workflow automation platform with additional services including Selenium WebDriver and n8n MCP Server integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Fully Automated Deployment**: One-click deployment using AWS CloudFormation
- **n8n Workflow Automation**: Complete n8n instance with PostgreSQL database
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For web automation and testing workflows
- **n8n MCP Server**: AI assistant integration for workflow management (accessible at `/custom-mcp`)
- **Caddy Reverse Proxy**: Automatic HTTPS with SSL certificates
- **Custom Domain Support**: Serve n8n on your own domain
- **Security**: Proper security groups and configurable secrets
- **Scalable**: Built on AWS infrastructure

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying this stack, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account**: With sufficient privileges to create CloudFormation stacks, EC2 instances, and other AWS resources
2. **S3 Bucket**: To hold the CloudFormation template file (AWS can create one for you, but having your own bucket avoids awkward auto-generated names)
3. **Domain Name**: A domain name where you want to host n8n (e.g., `n8n.yourdomain.com` or `automation.yourdomain.com`)
4. **DNS Provider**: Access to configure DNS records (Cloudflare, Route53, etc.) - Cloudflare is recommended
5. **n8n API Key**: You'll need to generate this in your n8n instance after deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This stack creates the following AWS resources:

- **EC2 Instance**: Amazon Linux 2023 with Docker and Docker Compose
- **Elastic IP**: Static IP address for your n8n instance
- **Security Group**: Configured for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, n8n (5678), and Selenium (4444)
- **Lambda Function**: For automated SSH key pair creation and management
- **SSM Parameter Store**: Secure storage for SSH private keys

## üöÄ Quick Start

### The "Big Green Button" Approach

Following [Saurabh's philosophy](https://saurabh-sawhney.medium.com/self-hosting-the-workflow-automation-tool-n8n-on-aws-ec2-d4d2abf06282), this stack is designed as a "Big Green Button" - you press it and everything gets done automatically. No more manual setup steps, debugging, or configuration headaches.

### Step 1: Deploy the CloudFormation Stack

1. **Upload Template**: Upload the `aws-stack.yaml` file to an S3 bucket
2. **Create Stack**: Use the CloudFormation console to create a new stack
3. **Configure Parameters**:
   - `DomainName`: Your domain (e.g., `n8n.yourdomain.com` or `automation.yourdomain.com`)
   - `WebhookUrl`: Your webhook URL (e.g., `https://n8n.yourdomain.com/`)
   - `N8nEncryptionKey`: A secure random string for n8n encryption
   - `N8nJwtSecret`: A secure random string for JWT authentication
   - `N8nApiKey`: Your n8n API key (generate this after deployment)

### Step 2: Configure DNS (Critical Step)

**Important**: This step is best done immediately after initiating the CloudFormation stack to allow DNS resolution to settle down by the time Caddy is up and running.

1. **Get Elastic IP**: From the CloudFormation outputs, copy the Elastic IP address (available almost immediately)
2. **Create A Record**: In your DNS provider (like Cloudflare), create an A record pointing your domain to the Elastic IP
3. **DNS Settings**: Use "DNS only" setting, **NOT proxied** - this is crucial for Caddy to work properly
4. **Wait for Propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 48 hours (usually much faster)

### Step 3: Access Your n8n Instance

After approximately 10 minutes (the time taken for setup on the EC2), your n8n instance will be available at:
- **n8n Interface**: `https://your-domain.com`
- **Selenium WebDriver**: `http://elastic-ip:4444`
- **n8n MCP Server**: `https://your-domain.com/custom-mcp`

**Voila!** That's it - no more debugging, no more configuration headaches. Just like [Saurabh's experience](https://saurabh-sawhney.medium.com/self-hosting-the-workflow-automation-tool-n8n-on-aws-ec2-d4d2abf06282), this should work smoothly the first time around.

## üîß Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration

The n8n MCP server can be configured in two ways: **HTTP mode on the server** or **local Docker mode**. Each approach has different use cases and limitations.

#### Option 1: Local Docker Mode (Recommended for Desktop Clients)

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other desktop MCP clients

This approach runs the MCP server locally using Docker containers. Each MCP client session gets its own container instance, providing true multi-session support.

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Multiple sessions** - Each client session gets its own container
- ‚úÖ **No authentication** - No need for Bearer tokens
- ‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup** - Containers are removed when sessions end
- ‚úÖ **No server-side setup** - Works with any n8n instance
- ‚úÖ **Isolation** - Each session is completely independent

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm", "--init",
        "-e", "N8N_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/v1",
        "-e", "N8N_API_KEY=your-n8n-api-key",
        "ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
1. **Cursor starts** ‚Üí Creates a new Docker container
2. **Container runs** ‚Üí n8n-mcp server in stdio mode
3. **API connection** ‚Üí Connects to your n8n instance
4. **Session ends** ‚Üí Container is automatically removed (`--rm` flag)
5. **New session** ‚Üí Fresh container with clean state

#### Option 2: HTTP Server Mode (For Web Clients)

**Best for**: Web-based MCP clients, simple deployments, single-user scenarios

The MCP server runs on your n8n server in HTTP mode and is accessible via your domain.

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **Single session only** - Only one client can connect at a time
- ‚ùå **Authentication required** - Bearer token needed
- ‚ùå **Server-side setup** - Requires Caddy routing configuration
- ‚ùå **Session conflicts** - "Server already initialized" errors with multiple clients

**Configuration:**

**For Cursor (HTTP mode):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "-H", "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer n8n-mcp-secure-token-55e2c81fceb0",
        "https://your-domain.com/custom-mcp/mcp",
        "-d", "@-"
      ],
      "env": {
        "N8N_API_URL": "https://your-domain.com/api/v1",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-n8n-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop (HTTP mode):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "-H", "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer n8n-mcp-secure-token-55e2c81fceb0",
        "https://your-domain.com/custom-mcp/mcp",
        "-d", "@-"
      ],
      "env": {
        "N8N_API_URL": "https://your-domain.com/api/v1",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-n8n-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Local Development

For developers who want to run the MCP server locally from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp.git
cd n8n-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm run start:http
```

Then configure:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/n8n-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "N8N_API_URL": "https://your-domain.com/api/v1",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 4: Local Docker HTTP Mode

You can also run the MCP server locally in HTTP mode using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name n8n-mcp-local \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_MODE=http \
  -e AUTH_TOKEN=your-custom-token \
  -e N8N_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/v1 \
  -e N8N_API_KEY=your-n8n-api-key \
  ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest
```

Then configure your MCP client to connect to `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

**Recommendation:**
- **For desktop MCP clients** (Cursor, Claude Desktop) ‚Üí Use **Local Docker Mode**
- **For web-based clients** ‚Üí Use **HTTP Server Mode**
- **For development** ‚Üí Use **Local Development**

**Note:** 
- Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain
- Replace `your-n8n-api-key` with your actual n8n API key
- The HTTP mode authentication token can be changed by modifying the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable in the AWS stack
- The MCP server endpoint is `/custom-mcp/mcp` (not just `/custom-mcp`)

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DNS Not Resolving**: Wait for DNS propagation or check your DNS configuration
2. **HTTPS Not Working**: Ensure your DNS A record is not proxied (DNS only) - this is crucial for Caddy to work properly
3. **Services Not Starting**: Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs`
4. **API Key Issues**: Generate a new API key in n8n settings
5. **Browser Security Warnings**: If you see "unsafe" warnings, ensure you're using HTTPS and proper DNS configuration

### MCP Server Troubleshooting

1. **502 Bad Gateway**: The MCP server container might not be running. Check with:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep n8n-mcp-server
   docker logs n8n-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure your MCP client includes the correct Bearer token:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer n8n-mcp-secure-token-55e2c81fceb0" https://your-domain.com/custom-mcp/mcp
   ```

3. **Wrong Endpoint**: Make sure you're using `/custom-mcp/mcp` (not just `/custom-mcp`)

4. **Caddy Routing Issues**: Restart the Caddy container to apply configuration changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart caddy
   ```

5. **MCP Server Not Starting**: Check if the environment variables are correct:
   ```bash
   docker exec n8n-mcp-server env | grep -E "(MCP_MODE|AUTH_TOKEN|PORT)"
   ```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs n8n
docker compose logs selenium
docker compose logs n8n-mcp-server

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Update n8n
docker compose pull n8n
docker compose up -d n8n
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

This stack creates the following billable resources:
- **EC2 Instance**: t4g.micro (~$8-12/month)
- **Elastic IP**: Free when attached to running instance
- **EBS Storage**: 30GB gp3 volume (~$3/month)
- **Data Transfer**: Varies based on usage

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: $10-15 USD

**Caution**: Since resources are created, AWS will start charging you accordingly. Be aware of this and delete the stack if you are no longer using the setup.

## üßπ Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, delete the CloudFormation stack when you're done:

1. Go to AWS CloudFormation console
2. Select your stack
3. Click "Delete" and confirm

This will remove all created resources.
